Write a version control system. Content can be checked in and checked out. Changes must be kept track of, so that rollbacks are possible.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control

How it works:
Place the folder: ‘VersionControlSystem’ in your working directory. Run the python (python 3 or above) script “main.py”. This will initialise the repo and also gives you the shell interface to run the commands. Following are the commands.

Commands:

> login username
	password

> create username
	password

> add file

> commit -m message

> log

> checkout commit_number

> delete commit_number
